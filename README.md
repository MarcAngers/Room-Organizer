# Room-Organizer
Attempt at making something to help re-organize your room :)

Brief introduction to the software:
- Start by entering the dimensions of your room, and hitting the plus button next to that input, this should pop up a room for you on the canvas.
- You can then add different pieces of furniture to the room that you would like to arrange in the next row down.
- To create different shapes in the software, you currently need to create multiple rectangles and put them next to each other (functionality to create different shapes for things potentially coming in the future).

I still need to make this app scalable for different devices, as it currently does not fit correctly on anything besides a 1080p or larger computer monitor by default.
